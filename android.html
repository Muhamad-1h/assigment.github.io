    <h1>Android</h1>
    <p>Android is a mobile operating system (32-bit and 64-bit) based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and
        other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
        Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely
        used version is primarily developed by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial
        Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.</p>
