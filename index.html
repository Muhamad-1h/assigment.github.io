    <h1>mobile operating system</h1>
    <p>A mobile operating system (OS) is software that allows smartphones, tablets and other devices to run applications
        and programs.

        A mobile OS provides an interface between the device's hardware components and its software functions. It
        typically starts when a device powers on, presenting a screen with icons or tiles that show information and
        provide application access. Mobile operating systems also manage cellular and wireless network connectivity and
        phone access.

        Millions of people use mobile operating systems worldwide, powering a wide range of devices, from smartphones to
        tablets and wearable technology. These systems offer users a wide selection of features, including calling and
        messaging, internet and cellular data connectivity, multitasking capabilities, interactive user interfaces and
        access to a wide range of third-party applications and services to enhance the user experience even further.</p>
